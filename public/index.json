[{"content":"This is a test Card\n","title":"Area","uri":"/card/area/"},{"content":"As “a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period”, Seneca’s lasting contribution to philosophy has been to the school of Stoicism. His writing is highly accessible and was the subject of attention from the Renaissance onwards by writers such as Michel de Montaigne. He has been described as “a towering and controversial figure of antiquity” and “the world’s most interesting Stoic”.\nSeneca wrote a number of books on Stoicism, mostly on ethics, with one work (Naturales Quaestiones) on the physical world. Seneca built on the writings of many of the earlier Stoics: he often mentions Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus; and frequently cites Posidonius, with whom Seneca shared an interest in natural phenomena. He frequently quotes Epicurus, especially in his Letters.\n","title":"Philosophy","uri":"/card/philosophy/"},{"content":"Ten plays are attributed to Seneca, of which most likely eight were written by him. The plays stand in stark contrast to his philosophical works. With their intense emotions, and grim overall tone, the plays seem to represent the antithesis of Seneca’s Stoic beliefs. Up to the 16th century it was normal to distinguish between Seneca the moral philosopher and Seneca the dramatist as two separate people. Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes: it is the uncontrolled passions that generate madness, ruination, and self-destruction. This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force.\n","title":"Projects","uri":"/card/projects/"},{"content":"Works attributed to Seneca include a dozen philosophical essays, one hundred and twenty-four letters dealing with moral issues, nine tragedies, and a satire, the attribution of which is disputed.

Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear both.\nAll you need to do is to advance; you will thus understand that some things are less to be dreaded, precisely because they inspire us with great fear.\nNo evil is great which is the last evil of all. Death arrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could remain with you. But death must either not come at all, or else must come and pass away.\n“It is difficult, however,” you say, “to bring the mind to a point where it can scorn life.” But do you not see what trifling reasons impel men to scorn life? One hangs himself before the door of his mistress; another hurls himself from the house-top that he may no longer be compelled to bear the taunts of a bad-tempered master; a third, to be saved from arrest after running away, drives a sword into his vitals. Do you not suppose that virtue will be as efficacious as excessive fear?\nNo man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or believes that living through many consulships is a great blessing.\nRehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart from life contentedly; for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks.\nMost men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die.\nFor this reason, make life as a whole agreeable to yourself by banishing all worry about it.\nNo good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than that which, when lost, cannot be missed.\nTherefore, encourage and toughen your spirit against the mishaps that afflict even the most powerful.\nFor example, the fate of Pompey was settled by a boy and a eunuch, that of Crassus by a cruel and insolent Parthian. Gaius Caesar ordered Lepidus to bare his neck for the axe of the tribune Dexter; and he himself offered his own throat to Chaerea.\nNo man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him.\nDo not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed.\nReflect that a highwayman or an enemy may cut your throat; and, though he is not your master, every slave wields the power of life and death over you. Therefore I declare to you: he is lord of your life that scorns his own.\nThink of those who have perished through plots in their own home, slain either openly or by guile; you will that just as many have been killed by angry slaves as by angry kings. What matter, therefore, how powerful he be whom you fear, when everyone possesses the power which inspires your fear?\n“But,” you will say, “if you should chance to fall into the hands of the enemy, the conqueror will command that you be led away,” – yes, whither you are already being led.\nWhy do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is that you have long been labouring under?\nTake my word for it: since the day you were born you are being led thither. We must ponder this thought, and thoughts of the like nature, if we desire to be calm as we await that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.\nBut I must end my letter.\nLet me share with you the saying which pleased me to-day. It, too, is culled from another man’s Garden: “Poverty brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth.”\nDo you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst, and cold.\nIn order to banish hunger and thirst, it is not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the purse-proud, or to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor is it necessary for you to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature’s needs are easily provided and ready to hand.\nIt is the superfluous things for which men sweat, – the superfluous things that wear our togas threadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores. That which is enough is ready to our hands.\nHe who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich.\nFarewell.\n","title":"Letter 4: On The Terrors of Death","uri":"/post/2019/07/30/letter-4-on-the-terrors-of-death/"},{"content":"You have sent a letter to me through the hand of a “friend” of yours, as you call him.\nAnd in your very next sentence you warn me not to discuss with him all the matters that concern you, saying that even you yourself are not accustomed to do this; in other words, you have in the same letter affirmed and denied that he is your friend.\nNow if you used this word of ours in the popular sense, and called him “friend” in the same way in which we speak of all candidates for election as “honourable gentlemen,” and as we greet all men whom we meet casually, if their names slip us for the moment, with the salutation “my dear sir,” – so be it.\nBut if you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship means.\nIndeed, I would have you discuss everything with a friend; but first of all discuss the man himself. When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment.\nThose persons indeed put last first and confound their duties, who, violating the rules of Theophrastus, judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him their friend after they have judged him.\nPonder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul.\nSpeak as boldly with him as with yourself.\nAs to yourself, although you should live in such a way that you trust your own self with nothing which you could not entrust even to your enemy, yet, since certain matters occur which convention keeps secret, you should share with a friend at least all your worries and reflections.\nRegard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal.\nSome, for example, fearing to be deceived, have taught men to deceive; by their suspicions they have given their friend the right to do wrong.\nWhy need I keep back any words in the presence of my friend? Why should I not regard myself as alone when in his company?\nThere is a class of men who communicate, to anyone whom they meet, matters which should be revealed to friends alone, and unload upon the chance listener whatever irks them.\nOthers, again, fear to confide in their closest intimates; and if it were possible, they would not trust even themselves, burying their secrets deep in their hearts.\nBut we should do neither.\nIt is equally faulty to trust everyone and to trust no one.\nYet the former fault is, I should say, the more ingenuous, the latter the more safe.\nIn like manner you should rebuke these two kinds of men, – both those who always lack repose, and those who are always in repose.\nFor love of bustle is not industry, – it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind.\nAnd true repose does not consist in condemning all motion as merely vexation; that kind of repose is slackness and inertia.\nTherefore, you should note the following saying, taken from my reading in Pomponius: “Some men shrink into dark corners, to such a degree that they see darkly by day.”\nNo, men should combine these tendencies, and he who reposes should act and he who acts should take repose.\nDiscuss the problem with Nature; she will tell you that she has created both day and night.\nFarewell.\n","title":"Letter 3: On True and False Friendship","uri":"/post/2019/07/29/letter-3-on-true-and-false-friendship/"},{"content":"Traditionally given in the following order:\nDe Providentia (On providence) - addressed to Lucilius De Constantia Sapientis (On the Firmness of the Wise Person) - addressed to Serenus De Ira (On anger) – A study on the consequences and the control of anger - addressed to his brother Novatus Ad Marciam, De consolatione (To Marcia, On Consolation) – Consoles her on the death of her son De Vita Beata (On the Happy Life) - addressed to Gallio …\n","title":"Seneca's essays","uri":"/work/essays/"},{"content":"Fabulae crepidatae (tragedies with Greek subjects):\nHercules or Hercules furens (The Madness of Hercules) Troades (The Trojan Women) Phoenissae (The Phoenician Women) Medea Phaedra Oedipus Agamemnon Thyestes Hercules Oetaeus (Hercules on Oeta): generally considered not written by Seneca.

This theme itself is completely plain-text and lightweight, and does not use any icons, images, or emojis.1 By default, the theme only uses two JavaScript libraries, MathJax and highlight.js, and they are loaded only when necessary. The rest of JavaScript is written from scratch and also relatively short. This theme does not use any CSS frameworks, and the full CSS code is also written from scratch (about 300 lines). It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more. — Letters from a Stoic This page introduces the features of this Hugo theme that you can fiddle with. Site configurations Below are the possible options that you may configure for a site based on this theme. Menus Each page has a menu in the header and a menu in the footer. The header menu is defined in the header option in menu in config.yaml, and similarly, the footer menu is defined in the footer option, e.g., menu:\rheader:\r- name: Home\rurl: \"\"\rweight: 1\r- name: About\rurl: \"about/\"\rweight: 2\rfooter:\r- name: Contact\rurl: \"404.html\"\rweight: 1\r- name: Categories\rurl: \"categories/\"\rweight: 2\rpre: \"optional\"\rThe url of a menu item can be either a relative URL pointing to a page on this website, or an external link (e.g., url: \"https://github.com/yihui\"). The order of the menu items is determined by the weight values. If a menu item has a pre value, it will be used as the class of the menu item. The special value optional indicates that this menu item will be hidden on small screens.2 The header menu can be made sticky via the parameter stickyMenu in config.yaml: params:\rstickyMenu: true\rHome page The body of the home page consists of an introduction, followed by a series of info cards, and then a number of the latest posts and pages. The introduction comes from content/_index.md. The Markdown content can contain arbitrary elements. The info cards come from the content/card/ directory. Each (Markdown) file is displayed on the home page as a separate card. The title is displayed vertically on the left or right side.3 If you want to customize the style of a certain card, you may use the YAML option style in the file, e.g., ---\rtitle: \"Courses\"\rstyle: \"background: darkorange; color: white;\"\r---\rThis will add a dark orange background to the card, and change the color of text to white. You can use any CSS styles here (e.g., font-size, background-image, and padding). The number of latest posts and pages can be defined via the homePosts option in params in config.yaml, e.g., params:\rhomePosts: 10\rThe default is 6. The mainSections parameter can be used to select the sections of pages to be included on the home page, e.g., params:\rmainSections: [\"post\", \"news\"]\rFooter Besides the menu in the footer, you can specify a copyright statement in the footer parameter in config.yaml, e.g., params:\rfooter: \"\u0026copy; Frida Gomam 2015 -- 2020\"\rComments Disqus, Utterances Searching This theme supports searching out of the box based on Fuse.js. A few critical configurations: The site needs to generate a JSON index. This is done via a layout file index.json.json in layouts/_default/, and the config in config.yaml: outputs:\rhome: [html, rss, json]\rA menu item with the ID menu-search configured in config.yaml, e.g., menu:\rheader:\r- name: Search\rurl: \"#\"\ridentifier: menu-search\rThe version of Fuse can be configured via the parameter fuseVersion in config.yaml, e.g., params:\rfuseVersion: 6.4.3\rIf no fuseVersion is specified, the latest version of Fuse.js will be used. You may also download a copy of Fuse.js to the static/ folder of your site and use this copy instead of loading it from CDN. To do that, you may download Fuse.js to, say, static/js/fuse.js and modify the partial template layouts/partials/foot_custom.html.
